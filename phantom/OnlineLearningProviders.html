							<h1>Assingment Description</h1>
							<p>This assingment is for starting to create a dipository of Online Learning Providers for future use in the classroom. An online learning provider (OLP) creates full lessons for students online. They are similar to traditional school-based learning providers, just online.</p>
							<h2> Online Learning Provider Chosen - <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</h2>
							<h3><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fifth-grade-math">Course 1 - 5th Grade Mathmatics</a></h3>
							<p>This is a complete course of what students need to learn to have a mastery of math at the fifth grade level. It was chosen because it has 16 units that tie to the Common Core standards for fifth grade mathematics. For use in the classroom, it has exercises that can be used for pretests to assess what the students already know. Those can also be used for exit tickets and quizzes. Optionally, the lessons in the course could be used as makeup assingments if a student is absent.</p>
							<h3><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/ela/5th-grade-reading-and-vocab">Course 2 - 5th Grade Reading and Vocab</a></h3>
							<p>This is a complete course of what students need to learn to have a mastery of reading and vocabulary at the fifth grade level. It was selected because of its 5 units that tie to the fifth grade ELA Common Core standards. The exercises can be used for homework assingments and exit tickets, while the lessons can be used as make up assingments for students who were absent for the actual lesson.</p>							
							<h3><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history">Course 3 - US History</a></h3>
							<p>This course has a complete guide for US history from 1491 to the present day. It can be used at any grade level to teach lessons that match the Common Core Standards for that grade. It was chosen primarily because in Elementary Schools Social studies is not a big focus so the standards are vague about what the students should know. Because of this, general US History is the best that online providers can solidify. For use in the classroom, exercises can be used as exit tickets and the quizzes and unit tests can be used as such.</p>
