							<h1>Assingment Description</h1>
							<p>This assingment is for starting to create a dipository of Exploratory Learning Sites for future use in the classroom. Exploratory Learning Sites are content focused so a student can explore different ideas that peak their interest instead of guided lessons.</p>

									<p>Crash Course is a company focused on giving free educational videos to everyone.It hosts its videos through a YouTube channel but can be watched and organized on their website. It was chosen because of how trusted it is a source of learning for so many people, with over 45 courses and 2 million subscribers. In the classroom, videos can be showed to students before the lesson to get them interested and make sure they have a base level of understanding in the topic.</p>

								<img src="images/Educ235/Coursera.png" alt="" width="550" height="294"/>
							<a href="https://thecrashcourse/com/courses/">
									<p>This is a complete course of what students need to learn to have a mastery of reading and vocabulary at the fifth grade level. It was selected because of its 5 units that tie to the fifth grade ELA Common Core standards. The exercises can be used for homework assingments and exit tickets, while the lessons can be used as make up assingments for students who were absent for the actual lesson.</p>
							<h3><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/us-history">Site 3 - asdf</a></h3>
								<img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" />
									<p>This course has a complete guide for US history from 1491 to the present day. It can be used at any grade level to teach lessons that match the Common Core Standards for that grade. It was chosen primarily because in Elementary Schools Social studies is not a big focus so the standards are vague about what the students should know. Because of this, general US History is the best that online providers can solidify. For use in the classroom, exercises can be used as exit tickets and the quizzes and unit tests can be used as such.</p>
